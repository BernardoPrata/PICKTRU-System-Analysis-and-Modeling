# PICKTRU Service - Architectural Representation

This project was developed for the Systems Analysis and Modeling course, in the first semester of the third year of the course in 2022/2023.

The objective of this project is to develop an architectural representation of the PICKTRU product, which will be used to create two different views. The diagrams to be developed are:

## First delivery - Business View:

- General Business Diagram (10%): A layered ArchiMate diagram using elements from the Business and Application layers.
- P-SET Process Diagram (10%): A BPMN diagram of the P-SET process, representing the private flow of activities of the D-PRJ of PICK.
- P-ON Process Diagram (10%): A BPMN diagram of the P-ON process, representing all collaborations involving PICK's teams, the collaborations between these teams and the client, and activities that result directly from these collaborations.
- B. Technology View and Integration of Models:

## Second Delivery - Technology View and Integration of Models:

- Updated versions of diagrams the first delivery, integrated into the Enterprise Architect tool.
- Use Case Diagrams (10%): UML diagrams representing the RUN and STORE systems' use cases.
- Class Diagram (20%): UML diagram of the RUN application's domain model, including a class that represents each item for sale in a store, as well as explicitly declared enumerated and non-primitive UML language types.
- State Machine Diagram (10%): UML diagram representing the life cycle of objects that represent the sale zones of items in a store, as per the RUN application's domain model.
- Block Definition Diagram (10%): SysML diagram representing the STORE system, including all non-primitive types of the SysML language represented in the diagram.
- Internal Block Diagram (10%): SysML diagram representing the STORE system, aligned with the block diagram (produced in B.5) and the use case diagram of the SMART application, which is part of the same system.

Overall, this project aims to provide a comprehensive architectural representation of the PICKTRU product, which will allow business and technology stakeholders to better understand the product and its functionalities.
